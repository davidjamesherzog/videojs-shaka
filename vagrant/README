========
USAGE:
========
To run tests:
    cd to this directory and then issue the following commands:
        vagrant up
        vagrant ssh
        cd /vagrant
        
        # note: `npm install` is slow - if you are using eclipse, it is helpful to
        # exclude node_modules from the package explorer - let it complete because
        # cancelling execution mid installation will cause you nightmares
        
        npm install
        npm run sample
